### Explanation of Key Components and Workflow

- **Permissions**: 
  - The application requires `INTERNET` to access Facebook's services. This guarantees that it can send and receive messages in a timely manner.
  - `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` is necessary to check connectivity status, ensuring that the message automation works without issues. This is crucial in scenarios where internet connectivity might be intermittent.

- **Activity Registration**:
  - `MainActivity`: This serves as the user interface where users can set up and configure their direct message replies. Upon launching the application, users can input their desired settings, making this the initial step of the workflow for automation setup.

- **Service Registration**:
  - `AutomationService`: This background service is responsible for the continuous execution of message monitoring and responding tasks. It operates independently of user interaction, ensuring that the application can function 24/7, which is a significant advantage of using MadHub's capabilities for social media management.

This configuration sets the foundation for a Facebook DM automated response tool, leveraging the features of the MadHub platform for effective social media management.
